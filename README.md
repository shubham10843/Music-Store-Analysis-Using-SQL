# Music-Store-Analysis-Using-SQL

This is my first SQL based project.

The Music Store had difficulty in growing their business, they had some questions regarding it. They have a database of invoice, tracks, customer, employee, album, genre. With the help of this database and knowledge of SQL, so i tried to solve their problems. Some problem statements have 2 methods to solve it.

Solutions other than mine are always welcome. Please comment such solutions.
